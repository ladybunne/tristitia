# Tristitia

Tristitia is a Discord bot that automates the logistics of organising a roster for The Baldesion Arsenal (a FFXIV raid). 

Currently she runs off a Raspberry Pi on my desk. She exclusively serves a Discord server called The Fire Place, which is a community for the Materia datacenter in FFXIV.

She is built with [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs/discord.js). A previous version of her was built in Python, and used a (then-abandoned) version of [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py).

## Installation 

None yet, she's not available for public use. Feel free to study the code if you like!

## Usage 

See above.

## How do I invite Tristitia to my server?

I have no plans to allow Tristitia to serve other servers at this time. That may change in the future.

## Credits

Thanks to **Liam Galt** for getting me started on this project, and for providing solid tech advice. The project probably wouldn't have happened without him.

Thanks to **Valla Von** for helping me debug the fresh hell that is JavaScript object manipulations and persistence.

Thanks to the following **beta testers**, for hopping in Discord and testing my jank in realtime:

- Artemis
- Crescendo
- Licia
- Maya

Thanks to the **BA participants** of The Fire Place for beta-testing Tristitia during Runs #2, #3 and #4. (I'm sorry about the triple lead DMs on #4.)

Thank you especially to the **supporting staff** of the above runs:

 - the party leads who helped make it possible
 - Whye and Eric, for bringing their Crystal expertise to Materia

Thanks to **CAFE**, the Eureka community that taught me how to BA, and brought me along on over 80 clears during my time on Crystal.
