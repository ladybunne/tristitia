# Post-release

## Features
- Descriptions
- Add support for different styles (rostered / password drop / FFA)
- Add support for perceptors/callers in overview embed

## Logistics
- Google Calendar support
- Start and stop stages
- Maybe a command to move people automatically to the BA East stage

## Moderation / Admin
- Commands: /move, /kick, /ban

## Safeguards
- Prevent raid leads from making multiple runs
- Prevent runs in the past
- Confirmation for create and cancel runs

## Misc
- Better config loading
- Probably make a User class of my own, to support future stuff like roles.
